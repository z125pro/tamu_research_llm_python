Q1: Marginal, Conditional
================================================================================

A researcher is examining the likelihood of electricity strikes on a pond. She has set up 15 bouys. There are 3 locations in the lake, and for each location there are 5 types of lightning rods. Her data tracked where lightning struck.

Table: Lightning strikes by rod type and location

| Rod       | Island | Middle | Beach | Row Total |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Aluminum  | 87     | 58     | 79    | 224       |
| Gold      | 70     | 38     | 88    | 196       |
| Copper    | 75     | 45     | 36    | 156       |
| Solenoid  | 74     | 27     | 40    | 141       |
| Silver    | 78     | 85     | 58    | 221       |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Col Total | 384    | 253    | 301   | 938       |

(a) [Free Response] If I randomly pick a lightning strike from this data set, what is the probability that it hit the Middle or Beach?

(b) [Free Response] If I randomly pick a lightning strike on a Gold rod, what is the probability it will hit the Middle or Beach?

================================================================================
Q2: Conditional
================================================================================

A Minecraft server has the following probabilities:
- P(Server down | no termites) = 0.22
- P(Server down | termites) = 0.88
- P(Termites) = 0.035

(a) [Free Response] If the server goes down, what is the probability termites were present?

| 3                     | 0.55 |
| 4                     | 0.83 |
| 6                     | 1.00 |

(a) [Free Response] What is the probability that someone will take more than 5 candies?

(b) [Free Response] What is the PMF f(1)?

(c) [Free Response] What is the PMF f(3)?

(d) [Free Response] What is the PMF f(4)?

(e) [Free Response] What is the PMF f(6)?

================================================================================
Q4: f(x) Standard Deviation
================================================================================

A random variable X has density:
f(x) = (480x² + 96x + 48) / 256  for 0 < x < 1.

(a) [Free Response] What is the standard deviation of X?

================================================================================
Q5: F(x) Probabilities
================================================================================

The cumulative distribution function of X (amps from an electric eel) is given as:
F(x) = (2^x + x^x) / 272, for 0 < x < 4

(a) [Free Response] What is the probability an electric eel will have more than 0.9 amps?

(b) [Free Response] What is the probability an electric eel will have between 0.9 and 3.4 amps?

================================================================================
Q6: P(X > a) - Normal Distribution
================================================================================

Let X be the incline of a street (degrees), be normally distributed N(8, 256).

(a) [Free Response] What is the probability that a random street is perfectly flat?

(b) [Free Response] What is the probability that a random street will be downhill?

(c) [Free Response] What is the probability that a random street will have an incline more than 35.2 degrees?

================================================================================
Q7: P(a < X < b) - Normal Distribution
================================================================================

X is N(637, 62²) feet

(a) [Free Response] What is P(521 < X < 766)?

================================================================================
Q8: Normal Percentile
================================================================================

Lawsuit payouts of a law firm follows N(63700, 620²)

The law firm wants to create a commercial that says, "You could win up to XXXX dollars," where XXXX represents the dollar value corresponding to the highest 4% of cases.

(a) [Free Response] What value should they use?

================================================================================
Q9: Z-Bridge
================================================================================

Battery life:
- Motorcycle: N(18.7, 4.74²)
- Truck: N(3.9, 0.62²)

They both use the same battery, the difference in the distributions is due to weight and usage.
A new battery lasts 44.1 hours in a motorcycle.

(a) [Multiple Choice] How long would we expect it to last in a truck?

Choices: 12.1, 51.84, 166.6, 0.6, 7.2, 326, -4.3, 2.7

================================================================================
Q10: Sample Standard Deviation
================================================================================

A shipment of five bags, each originally containing 337 ounces of dry ice, is being transported to Arizona.
The amounts of dry ice (in ounces) remaining in each bag after the trip are:
12, 24, 120, 224, 320

(a) [Free Response] What is the sample standard deviation of the amount of dry ice remaining?
